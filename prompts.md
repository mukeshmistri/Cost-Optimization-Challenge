Hi, Act as a Azure Cloud Engineer Architect expert & help me in solving the below query.

Devise a comprehensive and effective solution to the Cost Optimization Challenge involving the management of billing records within a sophisticated Azure serverless architecture. The service currently utilizes Azure Cosmos DB to store over 2 million billing records, each potentially reaching a size of 300 KB. Given that the system is read-heavy and older records, specifically those beyond three months, are infrequently accessed, the solution must prioritally reduce operational costs while ensuring uninterrupted data accessibility. The ideal strategy must be simple to implement and maintain, guarantee no data loss or service downtime during the transition, and preserve the integrity of the existing read/write API contracts without alterations. Additionally, provide an illustrative architecture diagram alongside pseudocode, commands, or scripts that highlight key logic for data archival, retrieval processes, and cost optimization methodologies.

What could go wrong? What about latency while accessing older than 3 months?

Evaluate and propose a robust and innovative strategy that is both self-sustaining and cost-efficient in comparison to the current operational setup. The focus should be on solutions like function apps, taking into account potential delays in startup when inactive. The primary objective of this strategy is to significantly reduce operational costs while ensuring continuous and uninterrupted data accessibility. Additionally, the approach must be straightforward to implement and maintain, guaranteeing no risk of data loss or service downtime throughout the transition process. It is crucial that the integrity of the existing read/write API contracts is preserved without any modifications. Please provide alternative strategies that align with these critical requirements.

Investigate which specific innovative solution most effectively aligns with the comprehensive theme of the "Cost Optimization Challenge: Managing Billing Records in Azure Serverless Architecture" within a cloud computing framework.

Alright, considering the data shared in second prompt, devise a master plan keeping above pointers in mind.

As a technical project manager, please provide a detailed analysis that includes the following key elements: A comprehensive cost overview comparing the existing setup with the proposed setup, specifically considering the current data and payload. Furthermore, include an illustrative architecture diagram that visually represents the system alongside pseudocode, commands, or scripts which effectively highlight the critical logic for data archival and retrieval processes, as well as methodologies for cost optimization. Additionally, present a concise project timeline that outlines the expected duration for achieving the proposed changes and implementations.

Make a list of what additional components we need to add & also add that costing in overall cost & justify why its needed

As a technical architect for a complex system, I need assistance in simplifying the architecture diagram that currently appears convoluted and challenging to interpret. Specifically, I would like to incorporate a more straightforward layout while clearly introducing the new components we intend to add, ensuring that there is no confusion regarding their roles and relationships within the system.

How our solution is different than below proposed solution, what added benefit we have?


Solution:
1)	As there are two types of records. First is the one which is used frequently while other is the one used rarely and needs costing to be reduced. To achieve this we recommend the solution as below:
•	Recent Records (less than 3 months old): These records must be kept under Azure Cosmos DB providing low latency and high availability for frequent reads.
•	Old Records (more than 3 months old): These records can be moved to azure blob storage under Cool tier (as the size of each record is 300 KB and these can be accessed within seconds under cool tier as well)
Blob Storage is significantly cheaper than Cosmos DB and thus will result in cost savings.
Note: azure function will be used to automate the archival process and restore archived records when needed.
2)	The stated solution will be achieved in 2 steps

•	Moving data older than three months from Azure Cosmos DB to Blob Storage.
•	Retrieving older records from Blob Storage back to Cosmos DB when they are requested.

3)	Moving data older than three months from Azure Cosmos DB to Blob Storage.

• We will use an azure function to check for records older than three months in Cosmos DB. This function will run as per the need (daily/weekly/monthly)

• Records older than 3 months will be moved to azure blob storage (cool tier) where the cost is significantly lower.

•	Once the records from the Cosmos Db are moved to blob storage, they will be deleted from the Cosmos DB.

4)	Retrieving older records from Blob Storage back to Cosmos DB when they are requested.

•	Whenever a user places a request for any data, they will first be searched in Cosmos DB. If data is available under Cosmos DB, it will be provided to user directly.
•	If the queried data is not available in Cosmos DB, it will then be searched under the Cold Blob storage using azure function. The data will then be fetched under Cosmos DB and then provided to user.
